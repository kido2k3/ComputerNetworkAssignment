Detailed Score Barem for the Demo: 
(The actual score barem may vary depending on the specific requirements and expectations of the course or instructor.)

Step 1 (1 point): Find out suitable network structures for buildings

Analyze the network system requirements of Headquarters and Branches.
Create a checklist to be surveyed at the installation locations.
Define areas with high load (network load) to select the appropriate device configuration (load balancers are placed in necessary locations).
Choose a network structure that matches the building's architecture with convenience and aesthetics.
Design the network usage in a wireless environment, applying network security standards and setting up partitions for network servers and devices (e.g., Server farm, DMZ, Firewall, ...).
Step 2 (1 point): List of minimum equipment, IP plan, and wiring diagram (cabling)

Provide a list of recommended equipment with typical specifications.
Create a schematic physical setup of the network.
Create a WAN connection diagram between Headquarters and Branches (using new WAN technology such as SD-WAN, MPLS, and OSPF routing protocol).
Step 3 (1 point): Calculate the required throughput, and expected bandwidth from ISP, then suggest the configuration for the company network

Step 4 (2 points): Design the network map using Packet Tracer or GNS3 simulation software

Step 5 (2 points): Test the system with popular tools such as ping, and traceroute, etc. on the simulated system.

Step 6 (2 points): Re-evaluate the designed network system through the following features: reliability, ease of upgrade, diverse support software, safety, network security, etc.

Address any remaining problems for the project.
Provide a development orientation for the future.
Step 7 (1 point): Upload the simulation file (using Packet Tracer or GNS-3) and the project report to BKeL before the deadline.

Bonus:

Apply a security plan.
Add firewalls and configure ACLs.
Implement IDS/IPS.
Edit a security best practice guide.
